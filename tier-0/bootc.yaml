# The bootc components.
packages:
 - systemd
 - bootc
 # bootc pulls in podman, which pulls in containers-common, which wants
 # `iptables`. Currently that pulls in iptables-legacy. Let's explicitly name
 # iptables-nft instead to satisfy it.
 - iptables-nft
 # Required by bootc install, sgdisk has been replaced by Rust crate
 # in bootc https://github.com/containers/bootc/pull/775

  # Exclude kernel-debug-core to make sure that it doesn't somehow get
  # chosen as the package to satisfy the `kernel-core` dependency from
  # the kernel package.
