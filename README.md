# Fedora bootc base images

Create and maintain base *bootable* container images from Fedora packages.

## Motivation

The original Docker container model of using "layers" to model applications has
been extremely successful. This project aims to apply the same technique for
bootable host systems - using standard OCI/Docker containers as a transport and
delivery format for base operating system updates.
